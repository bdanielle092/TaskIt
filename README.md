Name of Project: TaskIt

Idea: A task management app to keep track of my tasks and projects. 

Proposal:

Overview of app: For my capstone project, I am building a task app.  The app will have a list of tasks when you open it up. There will be a sidebar with different boards. You can create a board and add tasks to that board. You can also go to a board already made and add a task. Each task will have a place to add notes and to add a subtask. You can move a task to another board and choose a priority. 

MVP Definition:

1. User-specific CRUD and a isComplete checkbox for tasks 

2. User-specific CURD for the list(boards)  and  isComplete checkbox

3. User-specific to add notes and subtask 

Dream Stretch Goals:

1. User-specific be able to move a task to another board 

2. User-specific add priority to a task 

User Stories:

1. As a user I want to be able to add a board or go to an existing board 

2. As a user I want to be able to add a task 

3. As a user I want to be able to at notes and subtask 

4. As a user I would like to be able to move a task to another board

5. As a user I would like to be able to add a priority to a task
