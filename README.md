Name of Project: TaskIt
Idea: A task management app to keep track of my tasks and projects. 

Proposal:
Overview of app: For my capstone project, I am building a task app.  The app will have a list of tasks when you open it up. There will be a sidebar with different boards. You can create a board and add tasks to that board. You can also go to a board already made and add a task. Each task will have a place to add notes and to add a subtask. You can move a task to another board and choose a priority. 

MVP Definition:
User-specific CRUD and a isComplete checkbox for tasks 
User-specific CURD for the list(boards)  and  isComplete checkbox
User-specific to add notes and subtask 

Dream Stretch Goals:
User-specific be able to move a task to another board 
User-specific add priority to a task 

User Stories:
As a user I want to be able to add a board or go to an existing board 
As a user I want to be able to add a task 
As a user I want to be able to at notes and subtask 
As a user I would like to be able to move a task to another board
As a user I would like to be able to add a priority to a task
